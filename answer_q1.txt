Q1: If a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash.
Answer: Because we're calculating qi for each segmant using a weighted average, the fact there's no pixels in a given
segment means we're dividing by 0. We will try to calculate the weighted average but since we're dividing by the 
sum of the total pixels in the segment, the procedure will crash with a 'division by zero' error.
